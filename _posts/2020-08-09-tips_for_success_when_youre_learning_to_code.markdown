It’s fun learning to program with friends in classrooms, first Is programming really your thing? You can hardly succeed in programming if you don’t have a passion for it. If your only drive is to make money, you might not make it.

~ start off slow 

~work on one problem at the time

~relax when you need to

~ google for answers 

~ brain storming 

~ read the documentation

~ be patient 
Solving programming problems on paper first can help you to be flexible with iterations and be more relaxed. The easiest way to demystify a great idea without bothering about implementation too early is to use pen on paper or to use a whiteboard.

Before solving any problem on your computer, write the algorithm on paper, make mistakes, cancel them out, and allow yourself to be creative.
