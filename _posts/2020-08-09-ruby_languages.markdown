 When I first saw print in ruby I was like yayy! is that python unti I started seeing how structired the language was.
 Yet it is a complex language.
 The language comes up with a string of good things and compile-verifiability along with IDE support. It also comes up with dynamic typing properties that really help to get the projects bootstrapped as well as smooths along the changes, especially during the middle or the early stages of the projects.
